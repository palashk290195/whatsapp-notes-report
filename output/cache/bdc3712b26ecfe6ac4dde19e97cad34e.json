The main focus is a large screen displaying a slide titled \"Bid & Budget Optimization.\" The slide features a circular graphic with three vectors labeled \"Precision,\" \"Rationale,\" and \"Ambiguity,\" forming a triangular shape in the center of the circle. The screen has a grid pattern behind the circle, which has lighter and darker blue portions. To the left of the screen, there is a woman sitting and looking at her phone. In front of the screen, there are speakers and a portion of the stage visible, which is carpeted with a swirled design in shades of blue and white.
