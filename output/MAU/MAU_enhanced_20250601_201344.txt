The next block details a "Playable Ads Generation 1:1 Live Demo," scheduled from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM (local time: 6:00 AM - 1:00 PM). It highlights the use of AI to build interactive, performance-ready playable ads, featuring the ability to choose vertical or horizontal formats, plug in gameplay footage without design needed, generate interaction scenes in just a few clicks, and launch-ready creative in under 10 minutes. It includes a "BOOK YOUR DEMO" button, and notes it is sponsored by Appier. At the bottom, another event is listed from 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM that asks to "Ask a question about MAU" at Meeting Room 256.

He also did not understand he was there for a long time but he also did not have a strong belief in what tabjoy did and but recently he's been having conversations with people talking about rewarded UA again but the quality still may be a problem of the users. So but the other thing he said interesting was Exola is now launching an ad network. It has a lot of publishers on its like as in publishers but now it is trying to build for advertisers to serve ads on these publishers. And he said I will likely connect you to like their VP of engineering. So I said I'm happy to share whatever we learned on label ads.

21/05/2025, 17:20 - Palash: Voice note: So I think the key thing that camey in was rewarded videos. Not so much labels probably, but like rewarded videos is something that Neil would bet his money on very high cpm stop of pyramid and people completed. So there's one instance where somebody who added a subscription to remove all ads and people requested to bring back rewarded videos even if they were paying because. So you can buy currency or whatever with rewarded videos, like unlock a feature, unlock a template. How do you make people watch a lot of rewarded videos? Like make a bunch of templates and do it.

21/05/2025, 17:57 - Palash: Voice note: So I met App Appear at Creative AI. They acquired this team called Ad Creative AI. So they also tried generating code and stuff, but they did not. They realized that people also cared about quality and so on. And people didn't want that. So what they started doing is video to interactive and do to interactive is something that some people care about based on the quality it works for some people. But the advantage for them was appier as a platform does playable ads. So supports playable ads and mostly brand performance kind of marketing they do. So testing on App appear is like $2,000 per day. So candyare spends like $60,000 per day. So they'like we build like I think the senses that we'build the playable for you. So they acquired this Ad Creative so takes in inputs of videos and then creates into interactive. And then they have a lot of roadmap of what kind of labels can be created. And the other thing was what they also do is this people can go to playable freelancers and then create a lot of a bass playable with some requirements of like what configurations they want. And then these guys can generate like 50 multiple labable. And they said like a lot of labels can be done AB and it supports. But the problem is not like Meta for example like hundreds of labels. So anyway, yeah,

22/05/2025, 16:58 - Palash: Voice note: So I was speaking to Pole and Pol Day has a very interesting insight and he said like initially I apologize was a lot of people who want to make a lot of ads Pool Day ad is like video ads stuff but that is not the case. People want to have more control on the ads and they would create the same number of F but with more control and faster so that like tedious editing work if they were same point A to point B they want to go but like within from six hours to say 20 minutes. 75% of their creatives are still done by creative teams but 25% are done by marketing teams and their entry point is still marketers and yeah they'like people want control so that they can spend more time on research qualitative research on what kind of had to create rather than create thousands sws so there are some people who want to create thousands of ads like hundreds of ads but mostly it is the quality they want to maintain but faster.
22/05/2025, 17:08 - Palash: Voice note: Edge226 does performance sorry. Connected tv advertising they do in app also but connected tv so connectv advertising is on tv is controlled by ou but on other places like say Netflix or when you're watching Netflix, Amazon Prime Video that all that everything is connected tv. So buy they basically have platform where people can buy inventory and display these ads. So basically they'act tech there. So my the key assumption that I was making was aound connected TV was it's only TV but it's not. It's all this long form entertainment content within which ads can be shown.

One person is standing and gesturing while addressing the others, who are seated and facing him. A laptop is set up on a small table beside the speaker, displaying text that reads "Measuring up on AEG Sales". In the background, a bar-like setup with beverage dispensers is visible, and the "MGM GRAND" logo is displayed on the front. The setting includes plain white walls and a carpeted floor.
22/05/2025, 19:33 - Palash: This is an image: The image shows a group of six people gathered in what appears to be a conference or presentation setting. One person stands in the center, gesturing towards a laptop on a small table. The laptop screen displays some text, "MG… VERTICAL ASPECT RATIO". The other five people are seated or standing around, facing the presenter. Everyone is wearing lanyards around their necks.

Behind the group, there is a refreshment station with two water dispensers and an "MGM GRAND" logo. The setting appears to be a modern, well-lit room with neutral tones. A black Puma backpack is visible in the left corner of the image.
