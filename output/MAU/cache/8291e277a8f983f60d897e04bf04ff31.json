  "description": "So I met this guy, he wanted to like basically help startups and do sales and stuff. So he's been in tapjoy for some time. Thjoy is like rewarded you and stuff. So but yeah, I told him what, what stayage we are that what we've learned and so on. So he said okay. So basically hem I I spoke to like top what typab I did and so on. They said theywarded ua. He also did not understand he was there for a long time but he also did not have a strong belief in what tabjoy did and but recently he's been having conversations with people talking about rewarded UA again but the quality still may be a problem of the users. So but the other thing he said interesting was Exola is now launching an ad network. It has a lot of publishers on its like as in publishers but now it is trying to build for advertisers to serve ads on these publishers. And he said I will likely connect you to like their VP of engineering. So I said I'm happy to share whatever we learned on label ads. And also he said tabjoy also was into this label ads space and it was a huge pain to build these ads but you're right that testing costs a lot of money.",
