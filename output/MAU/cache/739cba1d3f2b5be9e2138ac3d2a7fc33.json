  "description": "So I met App Appear at Creative AI. They acquired this team called Ad Creative AI. So they also tried generating code and stuff, but they did not. They realized that people also cared about quality and so on. And people didn't want that. So what they started doing is video to interactive and do to interactive is something that some people care about based on the quality it works for some people. But the advantage for them was appier as a platform does playable ads. So supports playable ads and mostly brand performance kind of marketing they do. So testing on App appear is like $2,000 per day. So candyare spends like $60,000 per day. So they'like we build like I think the senses that we'build the playable for you. So they acquired this Ad Creative so takes in inputs of videos and then creates into interactive. And then they have a lot of roadmap of what kind of labels can be created. And the other thing was what they also do is this people can go to playable freelancers and then create a lot of a bass playable with some requirements of like what configurations they want. And then these guys can generate like 50 multiple labable. And they said like a lot of labels can be done AB and it supports. But the problem is not like Meta for example like hundreds of labels. So anyway, yeah,",
