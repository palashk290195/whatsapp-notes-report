The slide features a bar graph comparing revenue per install for Native, Flutter, React-Native, and Other frameworks. Each framework has two bars: a shorter red one and a much taller line with a red portion. The React-Native framework has a box highlighted in blue surrounding it. The background includes a curtain, ornate wall panels illuminated by blue lighting, and the corner of what appears to be a speaker cabinet.",
