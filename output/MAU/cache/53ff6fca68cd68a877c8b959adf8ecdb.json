  "description": "So I was speaking to Pole and Pol Day has a very interesting insight and he said like initially I apologize was a lot of people who want to make a lot of ads Pool Day ad is like video ads stuff but that is not the case. People want to have more control on the ads and they would create the same number of F but with more control and faster so that like tedious editing work if they were same point A to point B they want to go but like within from six hours to say 20 minutes. 75% of their creatives are still done by creative teams but 25% are done by marketing teams and their entry point is still marketers and yeah they'like people want control so that they can spend more time on research qualitative research on what kind of had to create rather than create thousands sws so there are some people who want to create thousands of ads like hundreds of ads but mostly it is the quality they want to maintain but faster.",
