  "description": "The image depicts a presentation slide titled \"Media Mix Recommendation Agent,\" detailing a system that uses AI to optimize media spend across platforms. The slide shows a flowchart that begins with input from various platforms (TikTok, Meta, Google), which is fed into \"Attribution and Performance Analysis.\" This data is then processed by an \"AI Recommendation Engine\" that considers \"Historical Performance Analysis,\" \"Industry and Geo Benchmarks,\" and \"Network's Performance Trends.\" This leads to \"Bidding Adjustment,\" \"Creative Changes,\" and \"Channel Prioritization,\" all of which are implemented by an \"AI Implementation Agent\" that outputs to the same platforms (TikTok, Meta, Google). \n\nThe slide is displayed on a large screen. Next to the screen is a wall with a patterned design. A partially visible podium with \"MAU VEGA\" is in the bottom right corner. The stage is lit with a blue hue.",
